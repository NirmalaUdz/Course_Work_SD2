          <p>Health and sanitation are vital for preventing diseases and maintaining well-being. Clean water, hygiene, and proper waste disposal reduce infections and promote public health.</p>
          <p>However, many people still lack access to basic sanitation, leading to waterborne diseases and pollution. Investing in sanitation and hygiene education is essential for a healthier future.</p>

          <h3>Impact on Women and Girls</h3>
          <p>The lack of proper sanitation facilities disproportionately impacts women and girls. In schools, the absence of private toilets often leads to higher dropout rates, especially during menstruation. Women and girls also face increased risks of harassment and violence when forced to use unsafe or distant sanitation facilities.</p>
          <p>Additionally, poor sanitation affects their health and hygiene, and the burden of water collection often falls on women, particularly in rural areas. These challenges emphasize the need for improved sanitation infrastructure to protect and empower women and girls.</p>

        <h3>Waterborne Diseases</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Cause of Illness: </strong> Drinking contaminated water spreads diseases like cholera, diarrhea, and typhoid.</li>
          <li><strong>Poor Sanitation:</strong> Lack of clean water and proper waste disposal increases waterborne infections.</li>
          <li><strong>Impact on Children:</strong> Children under five are most vulnerable to waterborne diseases.</li>
          <li><strong>Preventable Deaths:</strong> Many deaths from waterborne diseases can be avoided with clean water and good hygiene.</li>

          <h3>Poor Waste Management</h3>
          <p>In many areas, lack of proper waste management leads to waste accumulation in streets and water bodies, causing environmental pollution and the spread of diseases. Open dumping and burning increase air pollution and health risks, while plastic waste harms ecosystems. Poor waste management also creates breeding grounds for disease-carrying pests, further threatening public health. Proper waste disposal is crucial for protecting both the environment and human health.</p>

          <h3>Difficulties in Enhancing Sanitation in Impoverished Areas</h3>
          <p>Improving sanitation in poor areas is incredibly challenging due to insufficient resources, lack of infrastructure, and high poverty levels. Many communities lack access to basic sanitation facilities, making it difficult to eliminate practices like open defecation. Additionally, limited education on hygiene and the high cost of building necessary infrastructure make it even harder to implement lasting solutions. Overcoming these obstacles requires significant investment, government support, and community involvement.</p>
